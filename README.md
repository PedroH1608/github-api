# GitHub API Test

This project is a simple web application developed as part of the DevQuest program. The main goal of the challenge was to help learning how to use asynchronous JavaScript functions and the import/export syntax in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- Search for any GitHub user by username.
- View user profile information, including avatar, name, bio, followers, and following count.
- Display a list of the user's public repositories with details such as stars, forks, watchers, and main language.
- Show recent public events (Push and Create events) for the user.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3 (with custom variables and responsive design)
- JavaScript (ES6+ modules, async/await)
- GitHub REST API

## How to Use

1. Enter a GitHub username in the search field and click "Buscar" (Search).
2. The user's profile, repositories, and recent events will be displayed.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice using async/await for API requests.
- Organize code using ES6 modules (import/export).
- Manipulate the DOM to display dynamic data.
- Work with real-world APIs.
